# Wu Wei Assessment

Analyze whether you are forcing or flowing in a situation, revealing where effort creates resistance and where yielding would serve better.

---

## When to Use

- Feeling exhausted from sustained effort without results
- Encountering persistent resistance despite trying harder
- Sensing that something is "off" but unable to identify what
- Facing a decision about whether to push forward or let go
- User asks "Am I forcing this?" or "Should I keep trying?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The challenge, relationship, or goal being pursued |
| efforts | Yes | What actions have been taken, what energy expended |
| resistance | No | What obstacles or pushback has been encountered |
| desired outcome | No | What you are trying to achieve |

## The Wu Wei Framework

Wu wei does not mean inaction. It means action aligned with natural flow - effortless effort, doing by not-doing. The assessment distinguishes:

### Forcing (Li)

Signs that effort is creating resistance:
- Exhaustion without progress
- Escalating conflict or pushback
- The harder you try, the worse it gets
- Others withdraw or resist more
- You feel increasingly desperate or rigid
- Solutions require ever more control

### Flowing (Wu Wei)

Signs of alignment with natural movement:
- Effort feels sustainable, even energizing
- Progress happens with surprising ease
- Others naturally cooperate or support
- Timing seems to work out
- Flexibility and adaptation feel natural
- Solutions emerge rather than being forced

### The Key Insight

"The Tao does nothing, yet nothing is left undone."

Forcing works against the grain of reality. Flowing works with it. The question is not "How hard should I try?" but "Am I moving with or against the natural direction of this situation?"

## Diagnostic Questions

### 1. The Water Test
If you were water encountering this obstacle, would you:
- Push harder against it? (forcing)
- Flow around it? (wu wei)
- Seep beneath it? (wu wei)
- Wait and wear it down? (wu wei)
- Find a different path entirely? (wu wei)

### 2. The Effort-Result Ratio
- Is more effort producing proportionally more results? (healthy)
- Is more effort producing diminishing returns? (warning)
- Is more effort producing opposite effects? (forcing)

### 3. The Grip Test
What happens if you loosen your grip on this outcome?
- Things fall apart completely? (perhaps the outcome isn't natural)
- Things adjust and find a new form? (perhaps your form was forced)
- Relief and space emerge? (you were forcing)

### 4. The Source Question
Is your effort coming from:
- Fear of loss or failure? (forcing)
- Desire to control others? (forcing)
- Trust in the process? (flowing)
- Natural expression of care? (flowing)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Wu Wei Assessment

### Situation
[Brief description of what is being analyzed]

### Current Approach
**Mode:** Forcing / Flowing / Mixed

### Evidence of Forcing
- [Specific signs of resistance, depletion, escalation]

### Evidence of Flowing
- [Specific signs of ease, natural progress, cooperation]

### The Water Reading
[What would water do in this situation?]

### Root Cause
[Why forcing is occurring - fear, attachment, misalignment]

### The Paradox
[What Lao Tzu would observe about the situation]

### Wu Wei Alternative
[What flowing action might look like]

### The Invitation
[Gentle guidance, not prescription]
```

## The Paradox of Trying

"In the pursuit of learning, every day something is acquired.
In the pursuit of Tao, every day something is dropped."

Often, the path to achievement is through release, not effort:
- The harder you chase sleep, the more it eludes you
- The more you grasp at love, the more it withdraws
- The more you demand respect, the less you receive

This does not mean give up. It means: act from fullness, not from grasping. Move from center, not from desperation.

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I've been trying to get my team to adopt a new process for six months. I've explained the benefits, created training materials, sent reminders, escalated to leadership. People nod in meetings but nothing changes. I'm exhausted."

**Output:**

## Wu Wei Assessment

### Situation
Six-month effort to change team process, meeting persistent passive resistance.

### Current Approach
**Mode:** Forcing

### Evidence of Forcing
- Six months of sustained effort without adoption
- Escalation to authority (increasing force)
- Exhaustion despite continued effort
- Passive resistance suggests the team is yielding around you, not with you
- More explaining, more materials, more reminders - same result

### Evidence of Flowing
- People agree in meetings (superficial alignment exists)
- You care about the outcome (authentic motivation)

### The Water Reading
Water does not explain to rock why it should move. Water finds the path around, through, or beneath. It persists without force, adapts to the terrain, and eventually shapes the landscape without violence.

Your current approach: explaining louder to the rock.

### Root Cause
You are attached to a specific form (your process, your timeline, your way of adoption). This attachment has you pushing against rather than moving with the human terrain of your team.

### The Paradox
"The more prohibitions there are, the poorer the people.
The more rules and regulations, the more thieves and robbers."

More process, more training, more reminders may be creating the very resistance you seek to overcome.

### Wu Wei Alternative
Consider:
- What problem does the team feel? Start there, not with your solution.
- Who has already found their own way? Celebrate and learn from them.
- What if you stopped pushing for one month? What would naturally emerge?
- Is there one small change that costs nothing and helps everyone?

The best leader's work, when accomplished, makes people say: "We did it ourselves."

### The Invitation
Perhaps the question is not "How do I make them adopt this?" but "What are they already trying to do, and how might I support that?"

Flow where they are going. Do not push where you want them to be.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Lao Tzu** expert persona. Use it when effort is meeting resistance - to diagnose whether you are forcing against the Tao or flowing with it.
